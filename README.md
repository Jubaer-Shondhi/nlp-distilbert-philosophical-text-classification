# Philosophy Text Classification with DistilBERT

An NLP project that classifies philosophical texts into different schools of thought using DistilBERT transformer model.

## Project Overview

This project implements a multi-class classification system to categorize philosophical content into 13 distinct categories:
- **Plato** • **Aristotle** • **Empiricism** • **Rationalism** • **Analytic Philosophy**
- **Continental Philosophy** • **Phenomenology** • **German Idealism** • **Communism**
- **Capitalism** • **Stoicism** • **Nietzsche** • **Feminism**

## Features

- **Transformer-based Classification**: Uses DistilBERT for efficient text classification
- **Multi-class Classification**: Handles 13 philosophical categories
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Detailed performance evaluation
- **Comparative Models**: Includes Random Forest classifier for comparison

## Model Performance

The DistilBERT model demonstrates strong performance in classifying philosophical texts, with particular strengths in distinguishing well-defined categories. The project includes comprehensive confusion matrix analysis showing model performance across all categories.

## Results
- High accuracy for distinct philosophical categories
- Understandable confusion between related philosophical schools
- Robust performance across different text lengths and styles

## Key Findings
- Best Performing Categories: German Idealism, Capitalism, Stoicism
- Common Confusions: Between related schools like Analytic vs Continental philosophy
- Model Strengths: Handles nuanced philosophical terminology effectively
